# Project WebScrape Subscription Module

A tool developed with python to scrape Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace for new items defined by certain criteria. This tool will run every 15 minutes and send any new items to the specified email address.

The code uses the playwright and httpx modules to gather the data. Both modules offer asynchronous capabilities to perform faster scraping times.

The results are filtered to ensure only new and revelant items are sent.
